## Requirement
* Rust version 1.68.2 must be installed (during development we started with version 1.68.2, so we cannot guarantee that earlier versions will work);

## Installation
* Create a folder and open it through the console, or create a project and open the console through the IDE
* Clone repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/akiroqw/chat_app.git
```

## Usage
* First you need to collect all the projects so that Sargo will finish downloading the dependencies
```rs
  cargo build
```
* Then to start the client, you must first start the server for hosting.
```rs
  cd chat_server
  cargo check
  cargo run
```
* Next, you can start the clients
```rs
  cd chat_client
  cargo check
  cargo run
```
* If required, the following parameters must be changed(lib/Config.json):
```json
{
    "host": "127.0.0.1:6000",
    "message_size": 32
}
```
* This is the required message size and the host where TCPListener listens for connections and TCPStream which opens streams and connects to the host. 
You can change the listening host, but you also need to change the connection parameters.

## Ð¡hat system
The chat system is implemented by using standard libraries and classes TCPListener and TCPStream.
The server is implemented locally. Also the host thread is not blocked and does not wait for connection, which is implemented by this line:
```rs
set_nonblocking(true).expect("Failed to initalize non-blocking.");
```
The logic of the application is quite simple. Which increases understanding and usability.
